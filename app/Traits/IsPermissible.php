// Add the IsPermissible trait to any model that needs to check permissions, e.g. User, Role, Permission, etc.
// This trait serves as a placeholder for any methods that need to be added to the model to check permissions, as well as a way to identify models that have permissions.

//TODO: Add methods to check permissions to this trait. Currently a placeholder/dummy trait.
